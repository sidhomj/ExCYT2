# ExCYT2

## A Graphical User Interface for streamlining analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data


ExCYT is a MATLAB-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to analyze their flow cytometry data via 
commonly employed analytical techniques for high-dimensional data including dimensionality reduction via t-SNE,
a variety of automated and manual clustering methods, heatmaps, and novel high-dimensional flow plots.

This current version allows for multi-sample/multi-cohort comparative analyses. The main change in the workflow from
ExCYT to ExCYT2 is that following the importation of the fcs files, one can use the Assign button to assign files to cohorts
for comparative analyses.
